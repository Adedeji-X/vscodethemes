Preview themes from the VSCode marketplace.

**Built with**

* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/),
  [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
  [Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and
  [Static Site Generator Plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin)

## How it works

[TODO]

### Recursive Lambdas

[TODO]

### Draining the SQS queues

[TODO]

### Pre-rendering the frontend

[TODO]

### Sharing runtime and static types

[TODO]

### Infrastructure

[TODO]

#### Gotchas

We're using Terraform's count parameter to
[conditionally create policies, sns triggers and cloudwatch subscriptions](infrastructure/modules/backend/lambda/lambda.tf#L42)
for our lambdas. Since
[count cannot be a computed value](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12570),
this creates a scenario where when we create (or rename) a lambda we need to
deploy twice. Once to create the required sns topics, sqs queues and cloudwatch
events to create the resource ids to state and than finally a second time to
create the lambda function.

## How do I get my theme on _vscodethemes_?

Consult the
[VSCode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers)
for how to build your own theme. In order for your themes to show up on on
[vscodethemes](https://vscodethemes.com), they must:

* Be published to the
  [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads)
* Include a
  [public Github in the repository field](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/publish-extension#_advanced-usage)
  of your extensions's package.json
* Have
  [themes in the contributes field](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributesthemes)
  of your extension's package.json
* Theme definitions
  [must be JSON](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_create-a-new-color-theme)
  (not TextMate) and define `colors` and `tokenColors` â€’
  [Example](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro/blob/master/themes/OneDark-Pro.json)
* See [theme variables](backend/themeVariables) for which GUI and token colors
  are used

If you're not sure why a theme isn't showing up, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jschr/vscodethemes/issues/new).
