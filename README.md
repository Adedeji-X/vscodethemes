---

Preview themes from the VSCode marketplace.

**Built with**

* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/),
  [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
* [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
* [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
* [React Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter)

## How it works

The backend

* [Scrapes the VSCode marketplace](backend/jobs/scrapeExtensions.ts)
* [Finds all themes in an extension's Github repository](backend/jobs/extractThemes.ts)
* [Extracts colors from a theme](backend/jobs/extractColors.ts)
* [Saves the theme to Algolia](backend/jobs/saveTheme.ts)

The frontend

* [Renders search results server-side with NextJS](frontend/pages/SearchPage/SearchPage.tsx)
* [Extracts critical css with EmotionJS](frontend/pages/_document.tsx#11)
* [Implements universal error tracking](frontend/pages/_error.tsx)

The infrastructure

* [Uses a single, reusable Terraform module](infrastructure/modules/backend)
* [Is deployed automatically via TravisCI](.travis.yml#L28)

## How do I get my theme on _vscodethemes_?

In order for your themes to show up on on
[vscodethemes](https://vscodethemes.com) they must:

* Be published to the
  [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads)
* Include a
  [public Github in the repository field](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/publish-extension#_advanced-usage)
  of your extensions's package.json
* Have
  [themes in the contributes field](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributesthemes)
  of your extension's package.json
* Theme definitions
  [must be JSON](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_create-a-new-color-theme)
  (not .tmTheme) and define `colors` and `tokenColors` â€’
  [Example](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro/blob/master/themes/OneDark-Pro.json)
* See [theme variables](backend/themeVariables.ts) for which GUI and token
  colors are used

If you're not sure why a theme isn't showing up, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jschr/vscodethemes/issues/new).

Consult the
[VSCode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers)
for how to build your own theme.
